# Polygon Plugin Boilerplate

Polygon Plugin Boilerplate is a standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress Plugins. The curent version is based on the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate by Tom McFarlin.

## Features

- The Boilerplate is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/inline-documentation-standards/php-documentation-standards/).
- All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to be changed.
- The Boilerplate uses a strict file organization scheme that correspond both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure, and that make it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.
- The project includes a `.pot` file as a starting point for internationalization.
